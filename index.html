                As technology continues to advance at a rapid rate, fossil fuels and coal mines continue to diminish. With this, comes the need for renewable energy sources that can supply energy
                without gobbling up the limited resources we have on our planet. According to the Millenium Alliance for Humanity & the Biosphere (2019), nonrenewable energy sources like oil, gas, 
                and coal are estimated to run out in 70 years, possibly even faster with the energy consumption rising every year. Not only that, but the usage of coal and fossil fuels can cause to water 
                pollution and air pollution and is one of the main causes of climate change. The goal of üå≤‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is to push for the use of renewable energy sources to supply energy for the entire population,
                to save our population and its future generations.
